# ScheduleMe
ScheduleMe was built to help students develop and share their custom degree roadmaps.
Individual students face various degrees of challenges through their college careers. 
It might be difficult to communicate all of those things with their respective student advisors.
This application allows students to share amongst themselves their degree roadmaps that worked best for their individual needs, 
and allows other students to draw inspiration from them.
The application was developed in a team of 4 using SCRUM methodologies.
